A POSSIBLE IRREGULARITY IN ISPF STATISTICS (in the date fields):

         Description of the Problem:                                           c

           The particular "irregularity" that is addressed, is
           the packed numeric "create date" and "last changed
           date", when the packed number ends in X'nC' rather
           than X'nF'.  The problem rears its ugly head when a
           user program tries to display the date and uses an
           UNPK (unpack) instruction instead of using an EDIT
           assembler instruction.  If the packed number ends
           in X'nC', where n is a number from 0 to 9, then the
           UNPK instruction turns the nibbles around to create
           the byte X'Cn' (non-numeric) instead of X'Fn',
           which is numeric.  The non-numeric result ruins
           subsequent processing.  We wish to detect and
           correct all such errors:

         Getting the Tools:

           Program PDSCF can be assembled and linkedited into
           a suitable load library by customizing and running
           the job PDSCF$.  RESETCF (the tool to fix the
           problem) can be assembled and linkedited by running
           the job RESETCF$ after customizing it for your
           installation.  Copy the clist RESETCFF into your
           SYSPROC concatenation library, to fix the problem.
           (RESETCFC creates the problem, and RESETCFI is a
           diagnostic tool to show you if the problem exists.)

         Solution:

           The program PDSCF will expose the existence of this
           problem in a pds library.  Running the job PDSCF#1
           will detect all pds members with ISPF stats dates
           ending in a "C" instead of ending in an "F",  IF
           PDSCF#1 ONLY SHOWS THE NAME OF THE PDS DATASET, AND
           NOTHING ELSE, then all is well.

         When there is a problem:

          The RESETCF program was designed to fix this problem.
          Assemble and linkedit the RESETCF program into a load
          library (job RESETCF$) and then run the clist RESETCFF
          to fix the problem.  To make a test case and create
          the problem (to spoil the pds stats), run the clist
          RESETCFC.  And to just issue an inquiry as to the state
          of the ISPF stats in the pds, run the clist RESETCFI.
